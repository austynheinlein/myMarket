# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# CREATE TABLE locations (id SERIAL, company_name VARCHAR(16), address TEXT, image TEXT, phone VARCHAR(16));
# INSERT INTO locations (company_name, address, image, phone) VALUES ('Red Lobster', '2147 S Hamilton Road, Columbus, Oh 43232', 'https://www.redlobster.com/ResourcePackages/RedLobster/assets/dist/images/RL_Critter.svg', '614-864-3160');
