 #### Technologies Used
 This app was created using: 
 - Ruby on Rails 
 - PostgresSQL database
 - React front-end framework
 - Heroku deployment
 
 #### Future Goals
 In the future we would like to add more functionality to the map feature. We would like to program the map on the home page to show all the locations added to the database. In each locaiton show page, we would like a static map feature where users can see where that specific location s.
